Record audio from the microphone
This is a very simple app but it gets the job done easier than a more complicated choice such as VLC or Audacity.
You have to plug in an audio input device such as a webcam or USB microphone or USB sound card, then make sure it is set as default by right-clicking on the microphone icon on your taskbar.

To run: Menu -> Sound & Video -> Sound Recorder
To run in a terminal: gnome-sound-recorder

Tips:
1. In testing, the recorded audio quality was just a loud buzzing sound and impossible to hear anything else. If this happens to you, try changing the Audio Channel to Mono instead of Stereo.
2. You are supposed to leave the recorded audio in the app, and to actually save the audio somewhere, you are supposed to "export" it to a folder of your choice. But this is extra work and duplicates the data for no good reason, so here is the folder for saved recordings: ~/.local/share/org.gnome.SoundRecorder
